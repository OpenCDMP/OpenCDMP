# Introduction

**OpenCDMP** is an open and extensible software platform designed to simplify the management, monitoring, and maintenance of **Output Management Plans (OMPs)**, such as **Data Management Plans (DMPs)** and **Software Management Plans (SMPs)**. It provides a flexible and customizable environment that streamlines the complex processes involved in handling OMPs, ensuring efficiency, compliance, and collaboration across various projects and organizations.

- **Customizable Templates**: Offers a library of templates for various types of OMPs, customizable to fit specific project requirements.
- **Integration Capabilities**: Seamlessly connects with other software tools and platforms, enabling data import/export and interoperability via APIs.

## üß© **Core Concepts**

  - #### **Blueprints**

    Define the structure of a Plan by specifying its Sections and content.

  - #### **Plans**

    Primary entities representing comprehensive OMPs that guide research outputs throughout their lifecycle.

  - #### **Description Templates**

    Define the structure of Descriptions within a Plan, specifying required fields and content.

  - #### **Descriptions**

    Detailed entries providing specific information about research inputs, outputs, and processes within a Plan.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

OpenCDMP uses a **microservices architecture** with the following main components:

- **API Service**: Main backend (Java/Spring Boot)
- **Webapp Service**: Frontend application (Angular)
- **Notification Service**: Email and in-app notifications
- **Annotation Service**: Comments and review system
- **Repository Deposit Services**: Pluggable DOI assignment (Zenodo, Dataverse, etc.)
- **File Transformation Services**: Pluggable export/import (XML, JSON, DOCX, PDF)
- **Keycloak**: OAuth2/OIDC authentication server
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for inter-service communication
- **Elasticsearch**: Search and indexing

For detailed architecture diagrams and workflows, see the [Architecture Overview](https://opencdmp.github.io/getting-started/architecture/).
